# Wellcome to Addis-Algo official website 
![Sorting Algo display](/docs/images/image2.png)
Addis-Algo-web is an Algorithm visualization web app that uses VueJs as a front-end and NodeJs as a backend main frameworks. The website will help students and other
professionals to understand some algorithms and Datastructures visually. It also uses Bootstrap to decorate the frontend. Algorithms that power addisalgo are built from scratch without any third party dependencies. but this doesn't mean the project is not entirely independent. here are the dependencies I have used in my project:-

``` json
"dependencies": {
    "bootstrap": "^4.4.1",
    "chart.js": "^2.9.3",
    "core-js": "^3.4.4",
    "jquery": "^3.4.1",
    "popper.js": "^1.16.0",
    "vue": "^2.6.10",
    "vue-chartjs": "^3.5.0",
    "vue-page-transition": "^0.2.2",
    "vue-router": "^3.1.5",
    "vuex": "^3.1.2"
  },
```

I have built this web app to improve my Data-structure and algorithm skills by doing something meaningfull, So I will be very happy if you can contribute or open an issue on
problems you faced while experimenting my project.

The web app consists of 3 categories 
* Data-structures 
* Algorithms
* Machine learning

#### Data-structures 
This section will consists of some basic data structures like 
* Stacks
* Queues
* Bags
* Single Linked-List
* Double Linked-List
* Trees and
* Graphs

#### Algorithms 
This section will have the most interesting sections of the project that are 
* Searching 
* Sorting
* Path-Finding
* Tree-Transverse
* Graph-Transverse

#### First time setup

``` bash
git clone https://github.com/Tesfamichael1074/addisalgo-web.git
cd addisalgo-web
npm install
npm run serve
```



### Compile the projrct in production level
``` bash
cd addisalgo-web
npm run build
```



### Customize configuration
See [Configuration Reference](https://cli.vuejs.org/config/).
